# QGIS Vector Correction Plugin

The Vector Correction plugin allows users to warp and correct vector layers through the creation of correction
vectors which specify how different parts of the vector layer should be deformed.

The plugin offers a range of techniques for warping layers, including

- Linear
- Projective
- Helmert
- Thin Plate Splines
- Polynomial (Orders 1-3)

Documentation is available at [https://north-road.github.io/vector_correction/](https://north-road.github.io/vector_correction/).

The plugin is created by [North Road Consulting](http://north-road.com) on behalf of Natural Resources Canada.
